# ExperimentalPI
Uses a Monte Carlo random simulation to find the value of PI written in Octave. 

This is done by generating random points in a square and seeing which ones land within a circle. 
The ratio of points that land in the circle should approach the ratio of the areas of the circle and square as the number of iterations N approaches infinity.
